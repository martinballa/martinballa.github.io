Education
======
* Ph.D in Artificial Intelligence, Queen Mary University of London, 2024 (expected)
* BSc in Computer Science, University of Essex, 2018, 1st Class Honours

Work experience
======

* 2023 October - 2024 April: Research Assistant
  * QinetiQ
  * Duties include: Development of new algorithms and work on a fast simulation engine

* 2023 March - 2023 June: Research Assistant
  * Tabletop R&D
  * Implemented a digital twin for a published board game in the Tabletop games framework and ran large scale testing using various AI methods to get better insight of the game's balance and strategy space based on various questions that the designer had in mind. 
  * The results have been demonstrated at the UK Games Expo 2023 with a report available [online](https://www.tabletoprnd.co.uk/ukge23/violet)

* July 2020 - December 2020: Research Associate
  * Microsoft
  * Worked on Project Malmo which is Reinforcement Learning benchmark built on top of the popular video game MineCraft. The framework supports both single and multi-agent RL research with lots of customisable settings. Malmo presents lots of opportunities for research, but it has been considered difficult to use and get started with. My job was to lower the entry barrier for new users by improving the python API and create examples on how to use the framework. 
  * At the end of the project the new framework was presented as a Microsoft Research Webinar and also as a tutorial at the 2021 IEEE Conference on Games

* 2019: Research Assistant Programmer
  * Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL)
  * Implemented a JAVA version of the Pommerman framework with various Statistical Forward Planning agents, including Monte Carlo Tree Search and Rolling Horizon
Evolutionary Algorithm. As Pommerman presents various challenges (Partial Observability, Multi-agent, long-term credit assignment) the win/loss ratios were not informative enough to compare the agents, which required further analysis of their behaviours. 
  * A paper detailing the analysis of the agents and the framework has been published at AIIDE 19â€™ and the framework has won the Best Artifact Award.

* 2019-2023: Demonstrator/Teaching Assistant
  * Game Artificial Intelligence 
  * Multi-platform Game Development
  * Applied Statistics
